# Brain-tumor-detection
This model helps to detect the tumor in brain with highest accuracy rate.
Brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a significant advancement in medical image analysis. This approach leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify brain tumors from MRI images, which is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment. 

Key Principles:-
The project involves the use of CNNs, a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image classification tasks. CNNs can automatically learn and extract features from images, making them suitable for detecting anomalies such as brain tumors.
